# FootballersClassifier

As a person stepping into ML/DL world, I want to summarize knowledge I gained during course by doing easy classification task. The goal is to classify footballers to their pitch position (GK, DF, MF, FW) based on their season stats. I'm using 3 different aproaches and compare them with boxplots. There are also few plots with some interesting statistics as the best goalscorrer.
